RiteHash
========

Query [RiteTag](http://ritetag.com) API for list of similar hashtags &amp; their viral potential.

[API Docs](http://docs.ritetag.apiary.io) & [API keys](http://ritetag.com/developer/signup)

Usage:   `python rite.py <query term>`

Example: `python rite.py hackathon`

Why did I made this? Because I'm a [marketer & social manager](http://challengepost.com) and I want to know which hashtags are most likely to get picked up & amplify my content. Oh, and I can't resist a good hack.
